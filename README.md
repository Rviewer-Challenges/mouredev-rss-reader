## Technical requirements

* Create a **clean**, **maintainable** and **well-designed** code. We expect to see a good and clear architecture that
  allows to add or modify the solution without so much troubles.
* **Test** your code until you are comfortable with it. We don't expect a 100% of Code Coverage but some tests that
  helps to have a more stable and confident base code.

To understand how you take decisions during the implementation, **please write a COMMENTS.md** file explaining some of
the most important parts of the application. You would also be able to defend your code through
[Rviewer](https://rviewer.io), once you submit your solution.

## How to submit your solution

* Push your code to the `devel` branch - we encourage you to commit regularly to show your thinking process was.
* **Create a new Pull Request** to `main` branch & **merge it**.

Once merged you **won't be able to change or add** anything to your solution, so double-check that everything is as you
expected!

Remember that **there is no countdown**, so take your time and implement a solution that you are proud!
